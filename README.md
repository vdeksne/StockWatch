# StockWatch
This app is a Flask-based web application that integrates financial data, specifically stock quotes. It includes functions like lookup() to fetch stock data from an API, a login_required() decorator to enforce user authentication, and an apology() function for rendering error messages. It also formats values as USD using the usd() function. This app allows users to look up stock quotes and includes user login features to manage sessions.
